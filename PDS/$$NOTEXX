Hi Sam,
Just finished documenting the JCL file, FILE 560, and (if I remember to)
will send the XMIT file of additions and changes with this email.

As with the other files, I found a lot of trash and deleted those I
considered to be of negative value since they contribute nothing and
increase the size of the file. The deleted members are:
$COMMAND ABENDMAC ALIAS2   ASMCICS  ASMCMPLK ASMDASM  ASMWUCHA BC1JRPTS
