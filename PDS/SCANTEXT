//* READS THE MEMBERS FILE TO BUILD A TABLE OF MEMBERS TO BE INCLUDED *
//* OR EXCLUDED THEN READS THE STRINGS FILE TO BUILD A TABLE OF       *
//* STRINGS TO BE FOUND. OPENS EACH FILE WHOSE DDNAME BEGINS WITH     *
//* "INPUT". IF THE INPUT FILE IS A PDS, EACH MEMBER IS READ (UNLESS  *
//* EXCLUDED). FOR EACH RECORD READ, ALL LOWER CASE CHARACTERS ARE    *
//* CONVERTED TO UPPER CASE, THEN THE RECORD IS SEARCHED TO SEE IF IT *
//* CONTAINS ANY OF THE SPECIFIED STRINGS. IF IT DOES, IT IS WRITTEN  *
//* TO THE OUTPUT FILE.                                               *

//* THE STRINGS FILE MUST BE RECFM=FB,LRECL=80. IT CONTAINS THE       *
//* STRINGS TO BE LOCATED IN THE INPUT FILES. UP TO 500 STRINGS MAY BE*
//* ENTERED, ONE PER RECORD. THE STRING IS ASSUMED TO BEGIN IN COLUMN *
//* 1 (WHICH MAY BE BLANK, IF PRECEDING BLANKS ARE DESIRED), AND ENDS *
//* EITHER WITH THE LAST NON-BLANK COLUMN OR ONE COLUMN LEFT OF THIS  *
//* IF THE LAST CHARACTER CONTAINS A "<". IF THE LAST CHARACTER OF THE*
//* DESIRED STRING REALLY IS A <, IT MUST BE FOLLOWED BY ANOTHER <.   *
//* THIS PERMITS TRAILING BLANKS TO BE INCLUDED IN THE STRING.        *
//*                                                                   *
