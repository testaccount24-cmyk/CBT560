//*                 BC0THOR.PDS.JCL(ZAPRP001)                       *
//* THIS ZAP IS USED TO ELIMINATE CALLS TO IGZERRE FROM THE CHIPS   *
//* PROGRAM RP001A00. THE REASON THIS IS NEEDED IS THAT CALLS TO    *
//* IGZERRE INITIATE THE "REUSABLE RUNTIME ENVIRONMENT" (RTEREUS)   *
//* UNDER LANGUAGE ENVIRONMENT (LE). IBM REQUIREMENTS ARE THAT NO   *
//* PROGRAM BE LOADED INTO MEMORY FOR PROCESSING AFTER THE REUSABLE *
//* RUNTIME ENVIRONMENT IS ESTABLISHED. THE PRODUCTION VERSION OF   *
//* RP001A00 RUNS IN AN ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH ALL MODULES USED ARE   *
//* PRELOADED, AND SO NO MODULES ARE BROUGHT INTO MEMORY DYNAMICALLY*
//* AFTER RTEREUS IS ESTABLISHED. THIS IS ALSO TRUE IN SOME IMS TEST*
//* REGIONS, BUT IN OTHERS, ESPECIALLY THOSE USING COPE, IT IS      *
//* CONSIDERED TO BE TOO DISRUPTING TO TESTING TO HAVE TO STOP THE  *
//* REGION AND RESTART IT WHENEVER ANY CHANGE IS MADE TO ANY OF THE *
//* PRELOADED PROGRAMS. IT IS FOR THIS LATTER SITUATION THAT THE    *
//* ZAP IS NEEDED SO THAT THERE WILL BE NO CALLS TO IGZERRE.        *
//*                                                                 *
//* THE "VER" STATEMENTS BELOW VERIFY THAT CERTAIN HEX VALUES EXIST *
//* AT SPECIFIED PLACES IN THE RP001A00 CODE. IF ALL THE VERIFY     *
//* STATEMENTS ARE TRUE, THE "REP" STATEMENTS (REPLACE STATEMENTS)  *
//* ARE APPLIED SO THAT THE IGZERRE CODE WILL BE REPLACED WITH NOP  *
//* INSTRUCTIONS (0700) THAT DO NOTHING. IF RP001A00 IS CHANGED SUCH*
//* THAT THE CODE CONTAINING CALLS TO IGZERRE CHANGES, THIS JOB WILL*
//* FAIL, AND THE ASSEMBLY LISTING FOR RP001A00 WILL HAVE TO BE     *
//* SCANNED TO FIND THE NEW LOCATIONS AND/OR CONTENT, AND ALSO THE  *
//* CORRESPONDING REP STATEMENTS WILL HAVE TO BE CHANGED.           *
