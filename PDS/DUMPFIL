//* BY USING RECFM=U,BLKSIZE=32760, EACH BLOCK OF RECORDS ON THE    *
//* TAPE IS TREATED AS A RECORD, RATHER THAN AS A BLOCK, AND IS     *
//* PRINTED AS A CONTINUOUS LUMP OF DATA. THIS IS USEFUL WHEN YOU   *
//* DON'T KNOW THE REAL RECFM, LRECL, AND BLKSIZE AND WANT TO LOOK  *
//* AT THE DATA ON THE TAPE TO FIGURE IT OUT. NORMALLY, IT IS BEST  *
//* TO LEAVE OFF THE RECFM=U,BLKSIZE=32760 LINE AND LET THE LABELS  *
//* SUPPLY THIS INFORMATION. FOR AN UNLABELLED TAPE YOU WILL HAVE TO*
//* ENTER THE RECFM, LRECL, AND BLKSIZE, OF COURSE.                 *
//* THE LAST LINE IS A CONTROL CARD SPECIFYING HOW TO PRINT THE DATA*
//* AND HOW MANY RECORDS TO PRINT. COL 1 MUST BE AN *. THE 3 IN COL *
//* 2 SPECIFIES DATA IS TO BE PRINTED WITH CHARACTERS ON THE TOP    *
//* LINE AND THE HEX VALUES ON THE 2 LINES UNDER THE CHARACTERS. IF *
//* COL 2 IS A C, ONLY CHARACTER DATA IS PRINTED, AND NON-PRINTABLE *
//* BYTES SHOW AS PERIODS. THE N IN COLUMN 4 SAYS NOT TO PRINT A    *
//* LOCATOR BAR UNDER EACH LINE. IF YOU WANT THE BAR, LEAVE COL 4   *
//* BLANK. THE NUMBER IN COLUMNS 6-10 IS THE NUMBER OF RECORDS TO BE*
//* PRINTED, AND SHOULD BE 00999 OR LESS, AS THE PROGRAM ASKS THE   *
//* OPERATOR FOR PERMISSION IF MORE THAN 00999 IS SPECIFIED.        *
