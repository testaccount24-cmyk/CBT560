//*                 BC0THOR.PDS.JCL(PULLGRPS)                         *
//* READS THE MEMBERS FILE TO BUILD A TABLE OF MEMBERS TO BE INCLUDED *
//* OR EXCLUDED THEN READS THE STRINGS FILE TO BUILD A TABLE OF       *
//* STRINGS TO BE FOUND. OPENS EACH FILE WHOSE DDNAME BEGINS WITH     *
//* "INPUT". IF THE INPUT FILE IS A PDS, EACH MEMBER IS READ (UNLESS  *
//* EXCLUDED). FOR EACH RECORD READ, ALL LOWER CASE CHARACTERS ARE    *
//* CONVERTED TO UPPER CASE, THEN THE RECORD IS SEARCHED TO SEE IF IT *
//* CONTAINS ANY OF THE SPECIFIED STRINGS. IF IT DOES, IT IS WRITTEN  *
//* TO THE OUTPUT FILE.                                               *

//* THE STRINGS FILES MUST ALL BE RECFM=FB,LRECL=80. STRGINIT HAS     *
//* THE STRINGS WHICH BEGIN A LINE GROUP, STRGMTCH CONTAINS THE       *
//* STRINGS TO BE LOCATED WITHIN A LINE GROUP, AND STRGTERM HAS THOSE *
//* STRINGS THAT TERMINATE A LINE GROUP. UP TO 1500 STRINGS MAY BE    *
//* ENTERED, ONE PER RECORD. THE STRING IS ASSUMED TO BEGIN IN COLUMN *
//* 1 (WHICH MAY BE BLANK, IF PRECEDING BLANKS ARE DESIRED), AND ENDS *
//* EITHER WITH THE LAST NON-BLANK COLUMN OR ONE COLUMN LEFT OF THIS  *
//* IF THE LAST CHARACTER CONTAINS A "<". IF THE LAST CHARACTER OF THE*
//* DESIRED STRING REALLY IS A <, IT MUST BE FOLLOWED BY ANOTHER <.   *
//* THIS PERMITS TRAILING BLANKS TO BE INCLUDED IN THE STRING.        *
//*                                                                   *
//* THE LINE GROUP AND OTHER DATA IS PASSED TO THE PROGRAM WHOSE NAME *
//* IS ON THE PARM PARAMETER OF THE EXEC JCL STATEMENT. THIS PROGRAM  *
//* IS DYNAMICALLY LOADED AT RUN TIME.                                *

//* THE MEMBERS FILE IS NORMALLY DUMMIED, BUT MAY BE USED TO CONTAIN  *
//* A LIST OF PDS MEMBERS TO BE INCLUDED OR EXCLUDED. SEE COMMENTS    *
