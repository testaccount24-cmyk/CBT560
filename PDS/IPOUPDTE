//* DOC: THIS JOB CAN BE USED TO SEARCH THROUGH ONE OR SEVERAL
//*      PDS DATA SETS TO FIND ALL OCCURRENCES OF A
//*      PARTICULAR CHARACTER STRING.  PARM='CHECK' IS USED
//*      TO INSURE THAT NO UPDATING OF THE LIBRARIES OCCURS.
//*      TO FIND A PARTICULAR CHARACTER STRING ENTER A VALID
//*      IPOUPDTE CONTROL STATEMENT AS FOLLOWS:
//*           ABCD<ABCD<<
//*      WHERE 'ABCD' BEGINS IN COLUMN 1.  REQUESTING THAT
//*      ABCD BE CHANGED TO ITSELF (ABCD), WILL CAUSE
//*      IPOUPDTE TO PUT OUT ONE LINE SAYING 'LINE FOUND'
//*      FOR EACH OCCURRENCE OF THE CHARACTER STRING. ONLY
//*      CHARACTER STRINGS WITH VALID DELIMITERS (SEE THE
//*      INSTALL GUIDE) WILL BE FOUND.  IPOUPDTE COULD ALSO
//*      BE USED TO FIND ALL OCCURRENCES OF A CHARACTER
//*      STRING WHICH OCCUR ON THE SAME LINE AS ANOTHER
//*      STRING (ALL OCCURRENCES OF ABCD THAT EXIST ON A LINE
//*      WITH EFGH) AS FOLLOWS:
//*           ABCD<ABCD<EFGH<
//*      IN THIS CASE 'EFGH' NEED NOT BE VALIDLY DELIMITED.
//*
//*      A CARD SUCH AS:
//*           ABCD<1234<
//*      WILL CAUSE IPOUPDTE TO CHANGE ALL OCCURRENCES OF
//*      'ABCD' TO '1234' ON ALL MEMBERS WITHIN THE PDS. NO
//*      DATA WILL ACTUALLY BE UPDATED UNLESS THE PARM VALUE OF
//*      'CHECKM' IS CHANGED TO 'UPDATEM'
//*
//*      A CARD SUCH AS:
//*           ABCD<1234<XXX<
//*      WILL DO THE CHANGE IF AND ONLY IF THE LINE CONTAINING
//*      'ABCD' ALSO CONTAINS 'XXX'.
//*
//*      ANY LINE IN THE TARGET PDS WHICH CONTAINS THE CHARACTERS:
//*           .NU..RU.
//*      IS INVISIBLE TO IPOUPDTE AND WILL NOT BE FOUND OR UPDATED.
//*
